# Monzo Budget Tracker

---

Monzo Budget Tracker is a small project that uses the Monzo Developer API to interact with a given account. The objective for this project is not yet fully defined. However, I would like to begin by aggregating weekly/monthly data into a spreadsheet (and potentially sending via email, SMS, or similar) so that I can better track my spending.

The Monzo API is designed to be a predictable and intuitive interface for interacting with users' accounts. This API is **not suitable** for building public applications. More information and a description of the Monzo API is available [here](https://docs.monzo.com/#introduction). Alternatively, detailed documentation on how to use the Monzo APi is available [here](https://monzo-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access_token.html).
